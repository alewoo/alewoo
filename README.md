hi, i'm alex, a 20 y/o cs student at georgia tech who discovered his love for building at 16 — starting with a graphic design community that grew to 1.5k members during covid.<br><br>that spark for creation led me down an unconventional path: from releasing a rap album with 10k+ streams at 17, to leading my varsity squash team to become the #1 public high school team in the nation, to immersing myself in chinese culture through study abroad at 19.<br><br>these diverse experiences taught me one thing: whether it's building communities, creating music, or leading teams, i'm driven by the desire to innovate and make an impact. now, as a software engineer and entrepreneur, i channel this creative energy into building tools that solve meaningful problems.<br><br>i value doing the right thing, being a good human, and fostering genuine relationships. through cs, design, and creativity, i aim to build a better world — redefining the boundaries of what's possible.
